* [Learning how to learn](https://gist.github.com/sudomain/d88eef3dde6b174f4176b57aacca8f4d): Natural intelligence can only take you so far.
* [MITRE ATT&ACK](https://attack.mitre.org/): Self explanatory.
* [Guide to pointers in C:](https://denniskubes.com/2017/01/24/the-5-minute-guide-to-c-pointers/) This is required knowledge.
* [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html): Might be fun if you're looking into weirdly optimized code. Bonus points if you pump this into godbolt to see the assembly. Play around with the compiler options and marvel at the capability of our compilers.
