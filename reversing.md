**General:**

* [Reversing for beginners](https://beginners.re/): This is the holy grail. 
* [Become a full-stack reverse engineer in 3 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKG8-TnawY)
* [Practical Malware Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting-ebook/dp/B007ED2XDS): Everything here is user mode
* [Rootkit Arsenal](https://www.amazon.com/Rootkit-Arsenal-Escape-Evasion-Corners-ebook/dp/B007RFXCEW): More on the kernel side of stuff
* For wargames, check the playing CTFs section.

Do try out previous editions of Flare-Ons from FireEye, and try to play in the next coming one if you can.

**Hardware:**

* [The Hardware Hacker](http://index-of.es/Varios-2/The Hardware Hacker.pdf)
* [Hacking the xbox](https://bunniefoo.com/nostarch/HackingTheXbox_Free.pdf): A lot of the first generation xboxes were redesigned largely due to the RE efforts. It will not be easy finding an xbox to follow along this tutorial, but this book is still a gem nonetheless.
* [Embedded Linux Primer](https://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Linux-Primer-Practical-Real-World/dp/0137017839): Similarly, this is very old. Will be relevant should you choose to work on older systems with monolithic operating systems.
