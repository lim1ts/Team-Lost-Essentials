# Team Lost Essentials

Team Lost's guide to security and beyond!

This book is a collection of the stuff we have learned over the years, be it through NUS, CTFs, books or other ventures. This is not meant as a standard introduction to security or penetration testing by any means. If you feel like contributing, send in a pull request. Feel free to fork it if you want to. 

## How to use this book

Material discussed in the book is not meant to be exhaustive. This is not an introductory text. Readers might find this collection of information useful as a revision sheet or a long form cheatsheet - the chapters are written sporadically and the logical jumps between chapters are not very clear. We hope that this will be improved on in future iterations, but that is the least of our worries currently. There is still a lot of stuff left to write!
