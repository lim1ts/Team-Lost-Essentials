# Team Lost Essentials

This book is a collection of the stuff we have found useful when we first started in cybersecurity. This is not meant as a standard introduction to security or penetration testing by any means. This idea first came about in order to create an organized knowledge dump/reference for ourselves. 

## Disclaimer

We have used a myriad of offline and online resources; it is likely that most of this knowledge is available freely on the internet or at your university. References will be updated at a later date.

Also most of the flavour text is bs that I use to entertain myself while writing.

## How to use this book

Materials discussed in the book are not meant to be exhaustive. This is not an introductory text or a textbook even. Readers might find this collection of information useful as a reference sheet or a long form cheatsheet. We hope that this will be improved on in future iterations, but that is the least of our worries currently.
