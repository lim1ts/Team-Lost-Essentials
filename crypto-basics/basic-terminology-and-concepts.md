# Overview

Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of mathematical techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. It is not the only means of providing information security, but just one set of techniques. 

The CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security, and is listed as

| Confidentiality | Information is not made available to unauthorized individuals, entities or processes. |
| Integrity | To maintain integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data. The data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. |
| Availability | Information or data must be available as required. |
| Non-repudiation | One party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction |

### Substitution Ciphers

The basic substitution ciphers are block ciphers that substitute symbols by other symbols.

> A block cipher is an encryption scheme that breaks a plaintext into a block of fixed length T, and encrypts each block at a time.

There are different types of substitution ciphers.  
Homophonic substitution ciphers replaces each symbol in a plaintext message block with a randomly chosen string.  
Polyaphabetic substitution ciphers replaces each symbol with multiple substitution alphabets.  


 

Substitution ciphers by themselves are not enough to achieve security - it is too easily cracked.
