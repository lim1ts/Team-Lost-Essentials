# Data Encryption Standard {#firstHeading}

The Data Encryption Standard \(DES\) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. Although now considered insecure, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography.

DES has a key-length of k = 56 bits and a block-length of n = 64 bits. It consists of 16 rounds of what is called a “Feistel network.”

 For any blockcipher, and any key K, it is required that the function EK be a permutation on {0, 1}n.
