# Team Lost : CTF

As a small, fledgling team, we don't stand a chance against top teams like Shellphish and PPP. Our main goal of playing CTFs should be to learn, and hopefully one day we can become good enough to play in small regional competitions.

In time to come, we will populate this collection with a series of our writeups, but there's a lot of cleaning up to do.

* [Reddit advice on first CTF thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/24py5h/advice_for_my_first_ctf/) 
* [CTF field guide - Trail of bits](https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/)

Practice on wargames:

* [Exploit.education](https://exploit.education/): Previously known as exploit-exercises, from beginner to advance topics. 
* [Microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com/login): Good for learning reversing and pwning. 
* [Pwnable.kr](https://pwnable.kr/): one of the many sites hosting pwnable challenges. Finishing the first few challenges can be difficult for starters, but rewarding.
* [Crackmes](https://crackmes.de/): Lots of crackmes for your reversing needs. Link not working? [Try the mirror.](https://crackmes.one/)
* [Overthewire wargames](http://overthewire.org/wargames/): A classic! Old but gold. Check out their new Warzone too! It has the recent Advent Bonanza 2018 hosted.
* [WeChall](https://www.wechall.net/active_sites): Live aggregator of all challenge hosting sites. I've never actually used this, simply because there's too many to do.
