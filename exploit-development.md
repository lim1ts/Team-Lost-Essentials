**General Tutorials:**

* [RPISEC's Modern Binary Exploitation course](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE): One of the most highly recommended intro course to exploitation. This course is geared towards undergraduate students, and should be accessible to those with some understanding of Computer Architecture.
* [Windows exploitation series](http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/expDev/1.html): Beginner introduction by FuzzySecurity.

* [Windows Heap Exploitation](http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/mr_me/1.html): As above.

* [Corelan, BOF](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/): Everything in this series is a classic.

* [Azeria Labs](https://azeria-labs.com/): Azeria's materials are all ARM based, with heaps of RE on the side.
